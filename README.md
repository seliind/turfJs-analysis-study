# Analysis with using turfjs
I analyzed a dataset found in this link using Turf.js. The dataset contains information about stop smoking services in a region of the United Kingdom. I randomly generated the location data for a group of 6 friends who want to quit smoking. Then, I selected the most ideal service where they could all go together.
